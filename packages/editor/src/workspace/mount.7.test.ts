/**
 * The mount, driven through a real DOM.
 *
 * jsdom rather than the viewer's element double, because this shell reads what
 * a double would have to re-implement — `innerHTML`, `closest`, `querySelector`,
 * `activeElement`, `focus` — and a second DOM written for the test is a second
 * place the shell can be wrong about the first. The reducer beneath is driven
 * with no DOM at all in `host.test.ts`; what is proven here is the wiring.
 *
 * Every test goes through the PUBLIC entry point with a real store, so the
 * criterion — a typed host mounts the workspace and edits through it — is what
 * a consumer gets rather than what an internal happens to do.
